			<p>Hello,</p>
			<p>My name is Nahyan Khan, and I am a software engineering undergraduate at the University of Sheffield.</p>
			<p>This website was made as an assignment for the <a href="degree.html">COM1008</a> module as part of my course - this homepage contains some personal
				details about myself.</p>
			<p>I picked the course because I would like to work in a programming environment. I particularly am interested in
				programming computer games, and have made several small projects myself. I intend to learn the Godot engine in my own time to be able to further my skillset.</p>
			<p>The university experience that I've had so far has been by and large a great time! Getting used to living alone has been rather overwhelming, and
				learning to cook has been the most difficult undertaking so far. However, I thoroughly enjoy living in the city, with shops, bars and social events
				just a stones throw away.</p>
			<p>My main hobby is music - specifically, playing and composing. I am classically taught on the piano, grade 8, but I have also self taught myself drums,
			and am the drummer of a heavy metal band, <a href="https://7wanderer.github.io/index2.html">Shed Dust,</a> started by myself and my friend.</p>

			<p>Finally, I also make paid commissions for charts on a game called Clone Hero, though I rarely receive requests and when I do get one it doesn't earn me much.</p>
			<p></p>
