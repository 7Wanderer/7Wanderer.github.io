			<h2><a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/skills/sga">SGA</a></h2>
			<p>The Sheffield Graduate Attribuates programme is a presentation of attributes that the University of Sheffield and its external partners agree are important for success post-study,
			including academic success and employability.</p>
			<p>These attributes are developed both inside of the course and out, mainly outside in extra-curricular activities and work experience.</p>
			<p>There are three categories of attributes:</p>
			<h3>My learning</h3>
			<p>Skills involving the ability to learn and apply academic knowledge is vital in the workplace. The subject matter of the course related to the career is necessary, as well as
				research, critical thinking, and now more than ever, digital capability.</p>
			<h3>My impact</h3>
			<p>These attributes involve communication in all manners across the workplace - it forms the foundations of being able to work with others effectively. As well as this,
				inclusivity, positive contribution and decision making are other important attributes that allow for healthy collaboration.</p>
			<h3>My self</h3>
			<p>Attributes related to the ability to develop and maintain a healthy outlook and positive wellbeing. Defining purpose, personal development and creativity all fall under this category.</p>
			<h2><a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/skills/myskills">mySkills</a></h2>
			<p>mySkills is a portfolio of skills used by the University of Sheffield that allows students to build a profile of the skills they have obtained, both academically and in the workplace.
				 It provides a layout that makes it easy for students to create a CV, strengthening job applications and interview performance.</p>
			<p>The way it works is as follows:
			<ol>
				<li>Take a 'skills assessment' - a multiple choice questionnaire that describes your current level of a certain skill.</li>
				<li>Afterwards, the profile will be built and will highlight your strengths and weaknesses. Pick areas to prioritise improvement.</li>
				<li>Over time, build up this portfolio by keeping a record of your experiences and personal development.</li>
			</ol></p>
